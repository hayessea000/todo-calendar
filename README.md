# todo-calendar

## Descripion

For this project the user can enter todo items into today's calendar and keep track of what is past due, due now, or is yet to come.

## technologys

The webpage uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, dayjs, and jquery.

## learned

I learned how to make the webpage update to fit the time and day.

## Task

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Struggles 

The biggest struggle that I ran into during this project was using jquery only because normal JavaScript feels more natural for me.
## Usage

The webpage will load up any saved data from previous uses. Click the time block that has any todoâ€™s you want to enter. Then click the save icon to store the data. Time blocks that are past due turn gray, the current time block is red, and future time blocks are green.
